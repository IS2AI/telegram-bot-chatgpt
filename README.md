# ChatGPT for Visually Impaired and Blind
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than hundreds of million people have some type of visual disability today. Vision impairment has a personal impact with lifelong consequences because more than 80\% of our perception, cognition, learning, and daily activities are mediated through vision. As a result, visually impaired and blind people stagnate at work and in education due to inaccessible technologies. In this regard, we present a speech-based assistive system for visually impaired and blind people to interact with ChatGPT. The system employs automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and a messenger bot (Telegram) to chat with ChatGPT via voice messages. This repository provides a source code for developing a telegram bot for English (```voice_chat_gpt_en```) and Kazakh (```voice_chat_gpt_kk```) speakers. The English bot is deployed as ```@issai_chatgpt_en_bot``` and will be available temporarily for testing purposes.
